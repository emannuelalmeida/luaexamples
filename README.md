This repository contains examples of codes written in Lua for my presentation. 

My intention is actually to keep on increasing this though, until it becomes a good base of knowledge for those who want to start on this beautiful language.

Btw, not all code here is mine. Whenever some code belongs to another person, I'll provide the appropriate link to the owner.
